A component for a User entity, supports serialization and de-serialization of User objects and can be used from
both backend and frontend.

## Get started

Install and use the entity to create a new instance:

```ts
const user = User.from({
  username: 'Rodney',
  displayName: 'Rodney Roberts'
});
```

## Mock data

You can use announcement mock data for development and testing purposes using the `userMock` API.

```ts
import { userMock } from '@acme/acme.discussions.discussion';

const larry = userMock.larry;
console.log(larry);
```
