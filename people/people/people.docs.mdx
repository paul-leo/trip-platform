A plugable People aspect. Used to maintain people across the Wayne platform.

## Get started

Install the Aspect:

```
bit install @bitdev/harmony.examples.people 
```

## Compose to your platform

Compose it to your Harmony platform:

```ts
import { WaynePlatformAspect } from '@bitdev/harmony.examples.wayne-platform';

/**
 * compose the wayne.com platform.
 */    
export const WayneCom = HarmonyPlatform.from({
  name: 'wayne-com',

  main: [WaynePlatformAspect],

  runtimes: [
    new UIRuntime(),
    new NodeJSRuntime()
  ],

  aspects: [
    [PeopleAspect, {
      authProvider: 'bit'
    }],
  ]
});

export default WayneCom;
```

## Use the Aspect API

Use it in your aspect dependencies to get access to the People aspect API from your aspect:

```ts
import { PeopleAspect, type PeopleUI } from '@bitdev/harmony.examples.people';

export class MyAspectUI {
  static dependencies = [PeopleAspect];

  static async provider([people]: [PeopleUI]) {
    return MyAspectUI();
  }
}
```

## Fork the aspect

If you would like to customize the people aspect further to its capabilities you can fork the people aspect and cusotmize it for yourself.
